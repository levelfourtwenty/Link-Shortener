# Link-Shortener
The source code for my link shortener, written in PHP. Does not require Javascript.


## How to deploy

1. Change `YOUR_URL_HERE` on line 24 and 25 of `shorten.php` to your host url.
2. Place `shortener.html` and `shorten.php` in your webserver. 

## Drawbacks
The page that displays the shortened url looks pretty bad, I will look to improve it. 

~~As of right now, I have yet to implement a restriction on empty URLs, I hope to add this feature soon. ~~
