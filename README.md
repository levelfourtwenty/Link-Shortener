# Link-Shortener
The source code for my link shortener, written in PHP.


## How to deploy

1. Change `YOUR URL HERE` on line 21 and 22 to your host url.
2. Place `shortener.html` and `shorten.php` in your webserver. 

## Drawbacks
As of right now, I have yet to implement a restriction on empty URLs, I hope to add this feature soon.
